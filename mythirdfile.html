			<h4>Hello and welcome to my page. This is my first HTML markup so nothing will be special on here.</h4>
			<p>In this webpage, you will find basically nothing but very basic text to test my skills in coding. You may find a few photos lingering around or you make get lucky and the navigation tags actually work! What?!</p>
			<p>In order to test my skills though I will have some nonsensical stuff around while I work out the kinks of what I do and don't know about coding until I get to master my abilities in HTML. There will be a follow-up that has some CSS styling in it! Oh man!</p>
			Also, here's a list of my main objectives making this generic page<br>
				<ol>
					<li>Make HTML code</li>
					<li>Get an image on my page with a caption</li>
					<li>Insert Navigational Links</li>
					<li>Insert Links to my personal pages</li>
					<li>Make a correct copyright tag</li>
				</ol>
